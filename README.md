A very messy set of scripts to help with me planning workouts based on https://www.tierthreetactical.com/the-7-week-free-strength-training-program-pdf/.

Use at your own risk

Change 1rms and other vars and then
```
python plan_print.py > output.txt  

```

TODOs

* output to CSV
* fill out all fields not just big 4 lifts!
* use stdout to ask for 1rms, not hardcoded
* use stdout to ask for microplate y/n
